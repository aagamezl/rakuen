# Rakuen (楽園)

Your Mac, Perfected. A paradise of keyboard-centric control and streamlined workflow.

Rakuen (楽園), meaning "Paradise" or "Utopia" in Japanese, is an opinionated macOS configuration designed to transform your Mac into the machine you've always dreamed of. It tames the inconsistent Command and Control keys, brings fluid window management and Spaces control reminiscent of GNOME, and curates a set of applications and shortcuts that work in harmony.

This is more than a dotfiles repository; it's a blueprint for a saner, more efficient, and truly personalized macOS experience.

## ✨ The Vision
The default macOS environment is powerful, but it can feel fragmented. Rakuen is built on a few core principles:

* **`Ctrl` is King:** Reclaim consistency by making the Control key the primary modifier for global shortcuts, reducing finger gymnastics and cognitive load.
* **Tamed Windows & Spaces:** Experience window management that just makes sense. Move, tile, and manage your workspace with the fluidity found in other modern desktop environments.
* **Curated Workflow:** A hand-picked selection of applications and utilities that complement this setup, creating a cohesive and powerful toolset.

## 🤝 Contributing & Philosophy
